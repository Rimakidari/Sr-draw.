		<h1>Drawing Tips</h1>
     <h4>Let's learn some tips together</h4>
	</div>

	<div class="card">
     <h3>
	 Have the right pencil
     </h3>
     <p>Having the right pencil is important. The hardness of the graphite is indicated on the side of the pencil: 'B' pencils are softer, 'H' are harder, and 'HB' sits in the middle – there's a big difference between a 4H and a 4B."I recommend starting somewhere on the H scale as a foundation and then finishing with the darker B scale," says travelling convention artist Tim Von Rueden.</p>
	</div>

    <div class="card">
     <h3>
	 Hold your pencil correctly
     </h3>
     <p>"If you position your hand closer to the end of the pencil, you have more control and precision, but heavier strokes (darker markings)," says illustrator Sylwia Bomba.</p>
	</div>

   <div class="card">
     <h3>
	 Minimise the amount your hand smudges your pencil lines
     </h3>
     <p>"When shading, use an extra piece of paper underneath your hand," advises artist Brun Croes. "This will minimise the amount your hand smudges your pencil lines. If you're right-handed, start shading from left to right; if you're left-handed, start at the right and move to the left.</p>
	</div>
   
   <div class="card">
     <h3>
	 Create smooth
     </h3>
     <p>"Sometimes it's preferable for your shading to be less sketchy and more smooth and subtle," says artist Marisa Lewis.</p>
	</div>

   <div class="card">
     <h3>
	 Avoid symmetrical drawings
     </h3>
     <p>"I like symmetrical drawings, but they often look boring all too quickly," says Croes. </p>
	</div>

   <div class="card">
     <h3>
	 Create realistic sketches first
     </h3>
     <p>"Once you understand how to recreate something realistically, it becomes incredibly easy to then create a stylised version of the same object, especially for creatures and characters" Von Rueden </p>
	</div>

   <div class="card">
     <h3>
	 Create contrast
     </h3>
     <p>"Heavy contrast will demand attention," emphasises Von Rueden. "I recommend placing the highest value contrast in your area of intent focus. You can also add contrast to separate forms and distinguish different subject matter."</p>
	</div>

  <div class="card">
     <h3>
	 Avoid creating contrast everywhere
     </h3>
     <p> the softer, low-value contrast piece enables the eye to wander and doesn’t define an area of focus" says Von Rueden.</p>
	</div>

   <div class="card">
     <h3>
	 Use abstract backgrounds
     </h3>
     <p> "The use of irregular lines when shading adds a lot of dynamism to your sketch," Bomba says.</p>
	</div>

<div class="card">
     <h3>
	 Add character to your sketch
     </h3>
     <p> "Instead of just looking at what makes an object recognisable you should also consider how to make this object distinctive" says Von Rueden.</p>
